# Catpalooza Backend

Backend for fetching cat pictures using [the app](https://github.com/neboman11/catpalooza).

Uses MySQL as the database for storing images.

It is currently hardcoded to only work with my setup, but if someone actually wants to run their own verison of this, I can add a config file for specifying the MySQL connection information.
